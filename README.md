This is a repository for my code contributions which may never be merged with the official LinuxCNC branches.

It is intended as a 'first look' for pull requests which may not be merged, and also as a 'quick dump' for
any code that doesn't rise to the level of something that should be proposed to LinuxCNC's base-code.

All the best.
